CMPE-272 Assignment-1: Serverless Comparison

Task 1: Compare serverless options. Deep dive into AWS. Write a one pager for it.
This document provides a comparison of serverless options from three major cloud providers: AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure.

Task 2: Build a Docker image from source code
For this task, a Docker image was built from the source code of a sample application. The process included running tests within a container and subsequently pushing the image to a registry. For detailed steps and code, refer to the document.

Task 3: Compare performance of an application running in VMs vs containers
The chosen application was run on both the UTM Ubuntu VM and a Docker container. 

Conclusion
The choice of serverless option largely depends on the specific requirements of the application, the preferred programming languages, and other features offered by each cloud provider.
